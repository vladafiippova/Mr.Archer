			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p>For the qualitative construction of an adequate geological model of the oil formation, it is necessary to collect and process a complete lithological and petrographic data set. These rock characteristics determine reservoir properties, as well as geophysical parameters of petroleum-bearing fields. Subsurface geologic modeling has acquired extensive use for petroleum prospecting and exploration. In order to visually display petroleum bearing fields, a series of geoprocessing tools were developed to combine a petrographic cross-section data with the geologic map. This project will integrate geoprocessing tools to use on complex geologic problems such as visualizing petroleum-bearing fields. However, visualizing petroleum bearing fields has limitations in using geographic information systems (GIS) as a modeling system since it could not solve complex geological problems. To solve certain geological problems and to process a sufficiently large amount of data, Python-based geoprocessing tools need to be created for use in ArcGIS software. This combination opens up new possibilities for analyzing rock properties and generating geological cross-sections for visual interpretation. The project's goal is to develop a geoprocessing tool for visualizing a selected reservoir showing its oil saturation and porosity coefficients. Development of the tool will help to calculate an entire geological oil reservoir using knowing coefficients. The accuracy of the data interpretation for oil prospecting will increase with the use of geoprocessing tools. While the visualization and spatial analysis data are not widely available and are in high demand by petroleum and mining companies, this project will be able to grant access to the indispensable product. </p>
